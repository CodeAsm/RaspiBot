# RaspiBot
A Raspberry Pi will control an robot car on four wheels and camera for looking arround. The Camera will be mounted on a arm with 2 servo for horizontal and vertical movement independently from the robot car. An ultrasonic rangefinder will assist in avoiding small object and the camera will try to locate targets and calculate the fasted road towards it. This all will be done independently from any other system, it can however accept instructions from a portable rapsberry pi board over a Ad-Hoc wifi network, where it displays its livefeed. Also it will feature a phonehome system using a gprs board, and a subset of instruction can be send towards the robot using sms.
